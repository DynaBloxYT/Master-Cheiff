Spagetti
Shredded chicken and spaghetti stirred into a mixture of melted cheese, green onion, tomatoes, red and green chile peppers and creamy mushroom soup. A Classic Chicken Spaghetti with a little bite. This is a good last minute chicken recipe for a family, and my 2-year-old loves to eat this recipe with his fingers. Also, this dish freezes well.
